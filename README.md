## Our Goals

Our main goal is to create tiny graphic engine, which can be used to create a small 2D games.
  * We want to provide a simple engine, which can be built with NO external dependencies at all, so the core project can be built without installing any libraries (except for those, required by OpenGL).
  * We do, however, use a 3rdparty libraries, like tpunit++ or format, but they are either linked statically, or moved to plugins.
  * We want to provide an easy-to-use toolchain to satisfy simple most basic needs for  creating a simple game.

## Supported platforms

Currently, we support a following platforms.

  * Windows, using Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 (x86, x64)
  * Windows, using MinGW (x86/x64)
  * Linux, using makefiles (x86/x64)

However, we cannot provide binary builds for all of those platforms, only guarantee, that built source will work.
